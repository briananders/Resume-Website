				<header>Web Design</header>
				<p>
					<img alt="Web Design" src="img/WebDesign.png"/>
					Web Design is fascinating.<br/>
					<br/>						
					Making this website was one of the most fun things I have ever done. It was certainly challenging and it is constantly evolving. I'm sure it is not as great as it could be, but it is a great pet project of mine. <br/>
					<br/>
					Working on this site allows me to hone my skills in the web sphere. I have worked a lot on many other web projects, but regrettably they are under FDAs with my previous employers. Invariably, the thing I spend the most time on is the CSS. The look of a website is crucial to whether or not it is seen as valuable. <br/>
					<br/>
					For instance, Craigslist is a pretty decent site for what it is used for, but I rarely visit it because I hate the way it looks. I think it is one of the ugliest websites I have ever seen. To me it is unacceptable that the people there don't seem to care about the aesthetic of their website design.<br/>
					<br/>
					To me, the web is the future of technology. I hope to ride this wave. I want to live on the bleeding edge of web technology. I want to make the websites that blow people out of the water with their elegant designs and flawless interfaces.

				<p>
					<img alt="Mouse" src="img/Mouse.jpg"/>
					Throughout the years, I have built up this expectation in the world. All things should have a better interface. In my opinion, you cannot create a perfect interface unless it interfaces directly with your thoughts and intentions. <br/>
					<br/>
					Since that is not possible yet, I believe it is my mission (and should be everybody's mission), to try to make the world interface better. I find myself, all the time, saying "This has a bad interface." <br/>
					<br/>
					I spend a lot of time thinking about how some interface can be made better. Like iTunes; it's nice, but it's not perfect. I'm that crazy guy that looks at Apple products and thinks, "this could be better."

				<p>
					<img alt="Motorcycle" src="img/Motorcycle.jpg"/>
					I own a Motorcycle. It is a 1999 Honda Nighthawk 750cc motorcycle. It is beautiful. Every now and then it is really nice to just hop on the bike and go for a ride in the countryside.

				<header>Playing Music</header>
				<p>
					<img alt="Drums" src="img/Drums.jpg"/>
					I play instruments.
					<br/><br/>
					When I was 4 years old, I started in the Suzuki program on the violin. After my 8th birthday, I started playing the piano. In 5th grade band, I started playing percussion. As you can see in the picture, I still play the drums. <br/><br/>
					I still play all my instruments, but the drums are easily what I am the best at and they are my favorite to play.

				<header>Absorbing Music</header>
				<p>
					<img alt="Headphones" src="img/Headphones.jpg"/>
					I love music. I have a deep passion for music. I have an extensive music collection that I have been building up over many years. I have to have and iPod Classic to hold all my music and audio books. <br/>
					<br/>
					Some of my favorite bands include The Beatles, Foxy Shazam, Foo Fighters, Billy Joel, The Beach Boys, Awolnation, Blink 182, Lostprophets, Queens of the Stone Age, The Strokes, and many many more.<br/>
					<br/>
					I am also a big fan of classical and orchestral music. Some of my favorite orchestral music comes from movie soundtracks. Some examples would be John Williams works in Indiana Jones, Star Wars, and Jurassic Park. The work of Thomas Newman in Road to Perdition is one of my favorites too.

				<header>Movies</header>
				<p>
					<img alt="Movies" src="img/Movies.jpg"/>
					Fact: Movies are great. I am always trying to stay on top of the latest and greatest movie releases. I follow the movies of several directors. Some of my favorites include David Fincher, Steven Spielberg, J.J. Abrams, Guy Ritchie, and Christopher Nolan. I also follow the movies of some actors too.<br/>
					<br/>
					Movies allow one to experience the world through a different set of eyes. Movies have expanded my perspectives in countless ways. I believe that I would be a very different person without my history with film.

				<header>Cranes</header>
				<p>
					<img alt="Crane" src="img/Crane.jpg"/>
					My Dad owns a crane business as a hobby. He grew up running cranes and couldn't give them up even after getting his Ph.D. and becoming a full time professor of Economics. <br/>
					<br/>
					Naturally, I followed in his footsteps and grew up work with the cranes. Working with the cranes has given me many excellent skills. Part of the reason that I am so great at communicating is due to all the different people that I meet while doing crane work all over Iowa and Missouri. <br/>
					<br/>
					You meet all sorts while doing crane work and to keep things from getting weird, you need to be able to relate to people and converse well. <br/>
					<br/>
					Another skill that seems a bit more obvious is my technical and mechanical knowledge. It isn't too difficult for me to take apart almost anything and put it back together. I am a general Mr. Fix-it for many of my friends and where I work.<br/>
					<br/>
					Surprisingly, the beginnings of my mathematical aptitude started with the cranes. There is a lot of math behind lifting things. Tensile strength of cables, hydraulic pressures, cylinder diameters and their pressure capacities, etc. It all comes down to finding or creating a mechanical advantage.
