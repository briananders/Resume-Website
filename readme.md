##My Old Resume Site

This is the code that I used to run my personal website on the Graceland University servers: http://personal.graceland.edu/~bsanders/Resume/

I'm using HTML5 boilerplate. Pure HTML, CSS and Javascript. I was just learning, so it's very basic. My current website work is in the briananders.me repo. 

_Feel free to use this as an example to learn from._
