							This summer I received the opportunity to be an intern at <a target="blank" href="http://www.principal.com/">Principal Financial Group</a>. At Principal I was placed on the "CSS Corporate Services IT Java Team" which is a long way of saying that I made Java apps. The project I was working on is going to be a really important application when it finishes and they project that it will save the company several millions of dollars. The development cycle was almost a year, so I couldn't see it completed. <br/> 
							<br/>
							The project started when I got there, so I was a big part of making decisions for the app. We used lots of tech along with Java to get it rolling. We used the Spring Framework to do annotation-based operations, Maven to handle the dependencies, Dozer to do the class mapping, and Java Server Faces for the interface. We committed the code to our Subversion repository several times a day to keep the code straight between the developers. <br/> 
							<br/>
							Our project team decided that we would use a Scrum development methodology. There were only a handful of projects in the whole company doing Agile development when I was there. As a team, we split up the features for each sprint between the developers. I was assigned a few major features. I also tackled the majority of our JUnit tests. Along with Scrum, we were also trying out Test Driven Development in our project. For our JUnit tests we used EasyMock to mock the persistence rather than connecting to the real database.<br/>
							<br/>
							By the time I finished my internship, we had set up a strong foundation for the application. Most of our work was the hardest features, and the rest of the features will add on to what we already did.<br/>
							<br/>
							Working at Principal was a great experience. I learned a lot about corporate life, Java, and all those other technologies that I had never learned in classes at Graceland.<br/>
							<br/>
							Just like when I worked at Smith and Associates, I was under a FDA, so I can't share any specifics of the app or any of my code.

							Over the summer of 2011 I had the great opportunity to intern at <a target="blank" href="http://www.smithweb.com">Smith and Associates</a> in Houston, Texas. Working for Smith and Associates gave me my first real in depth exposure to corporate web technologies. Most of what I used there was Java Server Faces. <br/>
							<br/>
							The assignment I was given for the summer was to go through their in-house web apps and fix them. This basically meant that I had to redo a lot of features. I spent all summer breaking their systems and then fixing them. It was an excellent learning experience. When I left, they said that I was one of the most productive interns they had ever hired. <br/>
							<br/>
							I was under a FDA, so I can't show any of my code from Smith.

							<img alt="Film Projector" src="img/FilmProjector.png" />
							
							At the beginning of my freshmen year at Graceland, I started working at the Movie Theater in Lamoni. The Coliseum is a lot of fun. I was immediately put on the projector since I was good with my hands. At that time, we had a 32mm film projector. So, I had the pleasure of going through the system and checking all the safeties before each movie. I also was tasked with building the movies. <br/>
							<br/>
							If you are unfamiliar with the film industry, you order a movie from an agency, like Technicolor, and they send you a big metal canister full of 50 lbs. of film. The movie is in multiple reels so that it will transport more easily. You then have to splice the reels back together in the right order. If you put them in the wrong order, you may get the last 20 minutes of the movie somewhere in the middle of the movie and your customers are really confused about the direction that the movie took. The plot won't make sense and it's a mess.<br/>
							<br/>
							It wasn't long after being at the theater that they moved me up to the Supervisor position. As the Supervisor, my job was to sell tickets and keep all the money in order. I'm good at math, so that was a breeze. I still worked as the projectionist as needed.<br/>
							<br/>
							At the beginning of my junior year, we got a new manager and as the Coliseum hires only students as workers, we quickly realized that I new more about the workings of the theater than anyone else. So, I was promoted again to assistant manager. I still did supervisor and projection work as needed.<br/>
							<br/>
							At the beginning of my fifth year at Graceland, the manager quit to take on a bigger job. As I was clearly the most knowledgeable worker there, I was named Student Manager until they can hire a full time manager. I've been told to expect to be manager for the rest of my year at Graceland. I think I have been handling the new responsibilities well. I do the schedule, track hours, order all our supplies, along with many other tasks. Working at the theater has been a great challenge and an excellent place to grow in my leadership skills.

							At Graceland, one of the jobs I work is called STA+ (Student Technical Representatives Plus). The plus is there to include "everything else". At STA+ we help students, faculty, and staff with any tech problems they have. From things as small as "I need a data projector set up for my class at this location" to things as large as "we need you to totally rewire this smartcart for newer technology". It is a really great job and while working there, I have gotten to see all sides of technology. For instance, one of our last projects was to setup a server to broadcast announcements on a new channel at Graceland. At STA+ we get exposure to all sorts of technology. No discrimination; Mac OS, Windows, Linux, iOS devices, Androids, etc. We work with it all.

							My Dad owns a crane business as a hobby. He grew up running cranes and couldn't give them up even after getting his Ph.D. and becoming a full time professor of Economics. <br/>
							<br/>
							Naturally, I followed in his footsteps and grew up work with the cranes. Working with the cranes has given me many excellent skills. Part of the reason that I am so great at communicating is due to all the different people that I meet while doing crane work all over Iowa and Missouri. <br/>
							<br/>
							You meet all sorts while doing crane work and to keep things from getting weird, you need to be able to relate to people and converse well. <br/>
							<br/>
							Another skill that seems a bit more obvious is my technical and mechanical knowledge. It isn't too difficult for me to take apart almost anything and put it back together. I am a general Mr. Fix-it for many of my friends and where I work.<br/>
							<br/>
							Surprisingly, the beginnings of my mathematical aptitude started with the cranes. There is a lot of math behind lifting things. Tensile strength of cables, hydraulic pressures, cylinder diameters and their pressure capacities, etc. It all comes down to finding or creating a mechanical advantage.

							Just because something is considered done, doesn't mean it is. iTunes is this way. I have written JScript and AppleScripts to do functionality that is not available in iTunes's main interface.
							<br/><br/>
							I also made a <a href="../iTunes_Javascript.php" target="_blank">website</a> for many of my scripts. They are not locked down, so feel free to take them and play with them on your own.
							<br/><br/>
							Recently, I have started working on rebuilding my JScripts using AppleScript. AppleScript is one of the goofiest languages I have ever used, but I figured it out within a few short hours. I haven't added any of my AppleScripts to my website because Mac users have <a href="http://dougscripts.com/" target="_blank">Doug's Applescripts</a>.

							As most people know, the iPhone is a very popular Apple device. The iPad come out and now it is one of the most popular Apple devices ever. There is a huge ecosystem for Apps that run on iOS (the OS of Apple iDevices). So, I decided to try my hand at Apps. <br/>
							<br/>
							XCode is the IDE made by Apple for the development of iOS Apps. Working in xCode was a really nice experience. I find that Objective-c is a really good language. It makes a lot of sense. XCode is also a great IDE. It work smoothly, quickly, and doesn't let you make mistakes. XCode also has a few great features that are majorly different than anything I've used while developing in any IDE. <br/>
							<br/>
							XCode has drag and drop features for storyboarding your app. I can literally play with that and have my whole app setup visually before ever touching code. It's excellent.<br/>
							<br/>
							Naturally, like with Android development, my first app was a hex color mixer. Three sliders for red, green, and blue. As you slide them around, the color changes in the app and it shows the hex code for that color. It's pretty basic, but it is a good app.<br/>
							<br/>
							I have made a few other apps, but nothing that I felt was worth being put on the App Store.

							The Midwest Instruction and Computing Symposium is a regional conference where I am from. It is kind of a big deal to many Universities in the area. It's a conference for most of the time, but there is also a programming contest and a robotics
							contest. My junior year, <a href="http://www.alexcash.com" target="_blank">Alex Cash</a>, a good friend of mine, and I decided to team up
							and build a robot for the contest. We received Second place at the 2011 contest, our first year.

							I took a class on Android Programming. It was not very difficult. I found the work to be tedious and time consuming. I made a few cool apps, but nothing that I thought was play store worthy. Working with the Android SDK in Eclipse seemed a bit antiquated after working with xCode. Since I know Java, the programming wasn't hard, and since I know web design, the app interface setup wasn't difficult. <br/> 
							<br/> 
							My first basic app was just a box with three color sliders below for red, green, and blue. Based on where the sliders were situated, the box at the top would change colors and tell the hex code for that color. Pretty easy. <br/>
							<br/>
							Other apps I have done are for handy calculations. For instance, since I grew up working with cranes, I have an app that will calculate the lifting capacity of each of our cranes at different boom lengths and radii.

							For a class project, my Sophomore year (2009), we were given the assignment to take
							apart a computer and make it into something great. $300 in supplies later, including a 
							fish tank and 6 gallons of mineral oil, we had built a fish tank computer. Mineral oil is non-conductive. This allowed us to tear the shell off the tower and submerge the motherboard, power supply, etc. into the mineral oil. The mineral oil acts as a liquid coolant. Any moving parts, like the hard drive, had to remain outside the oil. <br/>

The friend is <a href="http://www.alexcash.com">Alex Cash</a>, and during my senior year, we built an arcade cabinet from scratch. We applied to get money to buy all the necessary pieces for construction, like plywood and screws. The request was granted, and we went to work. In my garage, we built the shell for the arcade. We then got a computer and set it up for MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator). After installing multiple emulators, we added ROMs for old games. The Arcade current runs some 6000 different games.

							At Graceland, one of the cool computer things we do outside of class is go to programming competitions. We go to at least one each semester. We usually have to program in Java or C++, but sometimes we get to program in many other languages, like Python. <br/>
							<br/>
							At these contests, teams are given a set of around nine problems to solve. Between the three on a team, there is one computer. The teams have to work together to try to solve as many problems as they can within the time limit (usually around 5 hours).<br/>
							<br/>
							My team is consistently one of the strongest at these competitions. In 2012, we scored in the top 15%, which is really good.

							The <a href="http://www.acm.org">Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</a> is the world’s largest educational and scientific computing society. At Graceland University, we have an ACM chapter. I have been an ACM student member since my freshmen year. We meet weekly to discuss current events in tech, watch presenters, and do activities.<br/>
							<br/>
							Last year, my fourth year, I was elected as Vice President of our ACM chapter. Throughout the year I worked hand in hand with the President and Secretary to make ACM great. We setup lots of speakers to come and talk about their field, we had game nights, and generally we had a great time. One thing we did that was a little different than the usual campus club was to reserve an area of the school news paper, The Tower, for an ACM article. We called it "Tech Now" and every two weeks we would submit an article about current and/or important tech news. I wrote several articles that year and they were a smashing success, as were all the Tech Now articles.<br/>
							<br/>
							This year, I am ACM President. The year has gone really well so far. Everyone seems to be enjoying it. I managed to recruit a new bunch of freshmen to come to meetings and strengthen our department. Freshmen have been catching me on the sidewalk to tell me how fun the last meeting was. This year we have continued the "Tech Now" article in the paper. So far, I have written all the articles. It has still been a hit again.

							<br/>
							I was recruited upon arriving at Graceland and have continued to be a leader in the program since. Ackerley scholars are supposed to be getting people to come to ACM meetings, go to programming contests, and we are also constantly working on new projects. <br/>
							<br/>
							To remain an Ackerley scholar, there are academic requirements that include keeping a high GPA, participating in programming contests and regularly attending CS/IT events.

							When I was very young, I started Cub Scouts as a Tiger Cub. Over the years I passed into the Boy Scouts, and after working diligently in the program, I excelled into becoming an Eagle Scout. To become an Eagle Scout, one is required to first move up the ranks, meeting the <a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AdvancementandAwards.aspx">requirements of each rank</a> and passing a board of review for each rank. <br/>
							<br/>
							One of the <a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AdvancementandAwards/eagle.aspx">requirements for Eagle rank</a> is to "plan, develop, and give leadership to others in a service project helpful to any religious institution, any school, or your community." My project was to build a big sandbox for one of the day care facilities in town. It was an 8'x8' box with a 14'x14'. I also had a 2' deep hole dug so that the sad was at ground level, yet deep enough for kids to have fun. I have been told that it was "one of the most intense eagle projects" they have ever seen. <br/>
							<br/>
							On December 21, 2005, I passed my board of review and became an Eagle Scout. You have to be under 18 to move up in rank. I know people that had their board of review the night before their 18th birthday. I was 15 when I gained Eagle rank. This left time for me to continue on and gain the bronze, gold, and silver palms. The palms are like gold stars on your Eagle rank. Each palm has their own requirements.
